Dear `Samuele Reghenzi <http://sammyrulez.blogspot.it>`_
########################################################

I would like to apologize to you and to the others submitters of which the talk
has been declined.

I agree with you, an email would be welcome !

I am aware than my organization for this event is not perfect because it's my
first event as main organizer. I'm really sorry for this inconvenience.

Indeed, I had written an `email <https://github.com/matrixise/python-fosdem.org/blob/master/pythonfosdem/templates/emails/talk_declined.txt>`_
in the case of the talk was declined but I just forgot to send it :(

Between the development of the website, the organization of this event, my
family, my job and many other things, I have just forgot to send you this email.

I am really really sorry.

Please, Could you accept my apologize ?

PS: Moreover, I would like to tell you thanks. I learned one thing today because
of you, I need to improve my organization for the next edition to avoid this
kind of inconvenience.

Thank you so much,

Best regards,

St√©phane Wirtel (@matrixise)
