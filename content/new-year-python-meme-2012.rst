###########################

1. Whatâ€™s the coolest Python application, framework or libraries you have discovered in 2012 ?
==============================================================================================


* VirtualEnv (virtualenvwrapper), this tool is really awesome, you can create a
  new environment for your test and your development. really useful if you want
  to contribute to a python project. just python setup develop and let's go.

* Requests (by `Kenneth Reitz`_) is a real advantage when you develop a http
  client because urllib is really bullshit.

* Python-RQ (by `Vincent Driessen`_), we can create a PubSub with Redis and it's
  easy.

* Gunicorn (by `Benoit Chesneau`_), a very good WSGI server, I use it for my own
  project, this wsgi server can be included in your own project via the python
  api.

If you want to monitor your processes you can use these tools.
