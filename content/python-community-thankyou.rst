:title: To the Python Community, Thank you for the FOSDEM !

Python @ FOSDEM
###############

How everything started
::::::::::::::::::::::

In September, I was at `PyConFR 2012`_ with `Ludovic Gasc`_ and `Christophe Simonis`_
and we discussed about an hypothetical event in Belgium.

I said, and why not at `FOSDEM 2013`_?

At beginning, Ludovic was thinking of a small joke but in fact it wasn't.

First point
:::::::::::

I began to make contact with some members of the `FOSDEM`_ team, the `AFPy`_, and
send some emails to the right contacts.

But this adventure was not easy to create.

* Contact the `FOSDEM`_ team and ask a devroom and wait for the result
* Contact a lot of potential speakers
* Create the `website <http://github.com/matrixise/python-fosdem.org>`__
* Create the committee
* Select the talks
* Publish the schedule
* Wait for the `FOSDEM`_ ;-)

And I just announced this event on `Hacker News <http://news.ycombinator.org>`_
This experience was really rewarding.

And now, it's a great adventure

To the Python Community, Thank You !
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

I would like to tell thank you to everybody !

With your presence, this event has been a real great success. 

I was very impressed and honored to meet you

Thank you so much !

----------------------------------------------
You and Affinitic are a great sponsor with your involvements in the Python
community. I was so happy to see your support at this event with your
sponsorship. I worked with him at Aragne at the beginning of Python in
Belgium (in the early 2000s). 

Thank you for your help.

`Alexis Métaireau <http://twitter.com/ametaireau>`_
---------------------------------------------------
I met you at the `PyConFR 2012`_ at Paris and you are a good guy. I discussed
with you about Werkzeug, Pelican and Cornice. 

For this event, you proposed a talk about the good practices for a dummy in
Python. During your talk, the room was full ;-)

Thank you,

`Andrea Crotti <http://twitter.com/andreacrotti>`_
--------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your talk about the "TDD from scratch". This talk is still
important and useful that apply to everyone (beginners or experts) because
you show the basis of a good product / component. And sometimes, we forget
those important details.


`Benoit Chesneau <http://twitter.com/benoitc>`_
-----------------------------------------------
This is the first time wherein I can discuss with you about gunicorn and
gaffer. The last time was at the pyconfr 2010, you showed the development of
gunicorn and I was impressed by the project and your technical skill.

Now, we discuss via irc or twitter and I appreciate our discussion.

Thank you,


`Brian Curtin <http://blog.briancurtin.com/>`_
----------------------------------------------
I don't know you but thank you for `your post on the PyCon blog <http://pycon.blogspot.fr/2012/12/cfp-for-python-room-at-fosdem-2013.html>`_.


`Christophe Chauvet <http://twitter.com/kryskool>`_
---------------------------------------------------
In the first place, you wanted to be in the PostgreSQL devroom, but after the first
talk you stayed in the Python devroom.

Thank you for your help in the devroom.

Hope to see you at a next OpenERP event.


`Christophe Simonis <http://twitter.com/kangol>`_

He helped me for the "`Python @ FOSDEM`_" `website <http://github.com/matrixise/python-fosdem.org>`_.  
From start to finish you were with me for this event. Thank you so much.

Thank you dude, you have received my email about this hypothetical event,
and you said me "Yes, I will go to FOSDEM".

Imagine this developer, he works for `Heroku <http://www.heroku.com>`_ in
California and he tells me, "yes I come", it's wonderful, awesome !

Thank you so much but I have one regret :( I didn't tell you face to face !
Hope to see you in a future event and thank you again.

You were the first speaker to present your talk and I think that it wasn't easy
for you. I have really appreciated your presence at this `Python @ FOSDEM`_.


`Ludovic Gasc`_

Until the week-end of the `FOSDEM`_, this guy does not know whether can help
