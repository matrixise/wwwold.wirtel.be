Dear Python Community,

I am really glad to announce to you that we will have a python devroom at

`FOSDEM <http://fosdem.org>`_ is a free event offering open source communities
a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. It is renowned for being highly
developer-oriented and brings together 5000+ geeks from all over the world.

Cheers,
