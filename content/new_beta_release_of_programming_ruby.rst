New Release of the "Programming Ruby"
=====================================

Cool, a new release of the last beta version of "Programming Ruby". I believe
that Andy and Dave will prepare a very good book. I look forward to having a
paper version.

Thanks again for your work.

Buy this book, it covers the last version of Ruby 1.9
