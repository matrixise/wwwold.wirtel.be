Montreal: act 1
===============

This noon, Stephane and I, take lunch with Marc-André Cournoyer and some of his colleagues of Standout Jobs. We talk about ruby (of course) but also about our future and our hypothetical immigration to Montreal. I follow Marc-André's advice and begin to blog more about my experiences and my discoveries in ruby and python (and probably about the difference between these languages).
