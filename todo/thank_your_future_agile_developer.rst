Thank you from a future Agile Developer
=======================================

I read "Practices of an Agile Developer" of Venkat Subramaniam and Andy Hunt ( @ Pragmatic Programmers ), and I can tell you this book is very interesting because I like theses words "You don't have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great". I think that it's a good citation of Les Brown. 

Andy, Venkat, Thank you for your book.
